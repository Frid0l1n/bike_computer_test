# Bike Computer Test

This project aims to create a simple open-source bike computer, similar to models from Garmin or Wahoo. We are currently in the very early stages, experimenting with breadboards and writing Python code to implement the basic functionalities.

## Own use cases
Since this is a big project, i'd encourage you to clone rename it and use it for your own puproses. I guess it is enough for a solid start into the field of diy bike computers.
